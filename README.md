# Music Genre Prediction

The "Music Genre Prediction" project was a freelance project aimed at developing and implementing a machine learning classification model that could predict the genre of songs provided. This project combined machine learning technology with the music industry to provide valuable results for singers, producers, and music platforms.

Project Objectives:

* Automate Genre Classification: The project aimed to simplify the process of determining the genre of a song by relying on artificial intelligence. This would help speed up the process of identifying more accurate music genres.
* Assist Artists and Producers: By predicting music genres, this project could provide valuable insights to artists and producers in planning and developing their music catalogs. They could better identify trends and audience preferences.
* More Accurate Music Recommendations: This project could also improve the quality of music recommendations on streaming platforms. By understanding music genres more deeply, platforms could offer a listening experience that better suits users' tastes.

Methodology:
The "Music Genre Prediction" project involved the following steps:
* Data Collection: Gathering a dataset from Spotify that includes a variety of songs with predefined genres.
* Data Understanding: After collecting the data, the next step was to understand it. This included understanding the data structure, types of data present, and what could be gleaned from the data.
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and processing the data, including extracting important features from songs such as melody, tempo, and harmony.
* Model Development: Building machine learning classification models, such as classification algorithms (KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes), to predict music genres based on song features.
* Model Training: Training the model on the available dataset to improve the accuracy of music genre predictions.
* Model Evaluation: Testing the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and conducting AB Testing.
